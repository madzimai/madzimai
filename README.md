I'm a Software Engineer with **8 years of experience** collaborating with teams and clients from around the globe. While I currently focus on building intuitive user experiences using **React** and **React Native**, I bring a versatile background as a **full-stack developer** — comfortable working across frontend and backend systems.

💻 Over the years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from:
- 📱 Personal mobile apps
- 🧾 Compliance management platforms
- 💸 Fintech and data-driven solutions

This hands-on experience has given me a **well-rounded view** of software development, allowing me to support teams throughout the full development lifecycle.
